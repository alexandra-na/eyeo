## Programming languages & frameworks used
Programming languages: python, Java
Frameworks: py.test, Junit, Selenium, Appium, RESTassured 

## With what I would start to improve/start automation
1. Get to know the project 
2. Review all lybraries/framework used (infrastructure) 
3. Learning and reading about JS and the JS style guidelines (GitHub, Google or Airbnb) 
4. Refresh my memory about python and reading again the PEP8 documentation 
5. See how Jinja2 is used in the project (and why it is used instead of Django)
6. Read about Node.js and the JS package manager
7. Read about mocha test framework 
8. Read Qunit documentation
9. See how selenium webdrive is used with JS

## What I changed
1. Removing some redundant code like assert.equal(handles.length, 3, "Popup is whitelisted" + description); because by default this assert compares the first two values.  
2. We do not need to use so we can use === (strict equality operator) so I replaced == with the strict equality operator. 

## What I learned
1. What is Qunit, Jinja 2, npm, mocha
2. How to use developer mode in chrome and adding/hadeling extensions (unpacked extensions)
3. How to install the ESLint package 
4. Npm command lines (e.g. npm list --depth=0) 
5. Btw couldn’t install markdown until I didn’t install setuptools-markdown (at list with the pip) maybe worth mentioning that in cms/README.md
6. How to use a new IDE (Webstorm)
